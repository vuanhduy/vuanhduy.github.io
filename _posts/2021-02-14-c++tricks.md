This note is a set of tips and tricks that I have learnt in coding with the C++ programming language.

## The RAII technique

[RAII]( https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/raii) stands for Resource Acquisition Is Initialization. It is officially defined as “a C++ programming technique which binds the life cycle of a resource that must be acquired before use to the lifetime of an object. RAII guarantees that the resource is available to any function that may access the object. It also guarantees that all resources are released when the lifetime of their controlling object ends.” This briefly means that we need to:

1.	Encapsulate each resource into a `class` (or `struct`): the constructor will acquire the resource, and the destructor releases the resource
1.	Use the resource via a **local instance** of the class (i.e., not a pointer or static variable)

Let look at the following example.

```C++
void notUseRAII() {
    char *msg = nullptr;
    int ret = mystery_function(&msg);   // msg is allocated by mystery_function (when success)
                                        // and must be manually freed latter
    if (ret != 0)       // there is an error and msg has not been allocated.
        return;

    // Do something ...

    delete msg;
}
```

Although function `notUseRAII` looks good, there is a potential memory leak. If an exception occurs while `Doing something`, then `delete` is not invoked. Thus, there will be a memory leak.

Now, let apply RAII by wrapping `msg` using a `struct`.

```C++
struct MsgWrapper {
    MsgWrapper() {
        status = mystery_function(&msg);
    }

    ~MsgWrapper() {
        if (msg != nullptr)
            delete msg;
    }

    char *msg = nullptr;
    int status;
};

void useRAII() {
    struct MsgWrapper wrapper;
    if (wrapper.status != 0)       // cannot get security context of the process
        return;

    // Do something ...
}
```

As `wrapper` is a **local variable**, its destructor is guaranteed to be invoked when leaving function `useRAII` for any reason. Thus, the memory of the `msg` is ensured to be deallocated.

## Working with containers

### `auto` specifier in a range-based for loop

[Range-based for loop](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/range-for) has been introduced since C++11 and used as a more readable equivalent to the traditional for loop operating. The `range_declaration` part often uses the `auto` specifier for automatic type deduction (and  reduces code modification when updating elements' type.) It is important to remember that `auto` represents a value type. Thus, each iteration of the loop copies an element of the container, and any modification won't affect the corresponding original member. As being shown in the following example, method `append` does not modify any strings inside `my_strings`:

```C++
void useValueRangeBasedForLoop() {
    std::vector<std::string> strings { "first", "second", "third" };
    for(auto s : strings) {
        s.append(" new string");
    }

    // This will print: "frist", "second" and "third"
    for(auto s : strings) {
        std::cout << s << std::endl;
    }
}
```

To make the effect, we need to modify the `auto` with `&` symbol to represent a reference type:

```C++
void useReferenceRangeBasedForLoop() {
    std::vector<std::string> strings { "first", "second", "third" };
    for(auto &s : strings) {
        s.append(" new string");
    }

    // This will print: "frist new string", "second new string" and "third new string"
    for(auto s : strings) {
        std::cout << s << std::endl;
    }
}
```

### Finding an element with std::find_if

Another operation that I often do with containers is to find an element satisfying a criterion. Instead of writing a loop, I utilize `std:find_if`:

```C++
#include <algorithm>

void findFirstOccurence(const std::vector<std::string> &haystack, const std::string &needle) {
    auto str = std::find_if(haystack.begin(), haystack.end(),
                            [&](const std::string &s) { return s == needle; });
    if(str != haystack.end()) {
        std::cout << "found " << *str << " at " << std::distance(haystack.begin(), str) << std::endl;
    }
}
```

And if I want to find the 2nd, 3rd or nth occurrence instead of the first one:

```C++
#include <algorithm>

void findNthOccurence(const std::vector<std::string> &haystack, const std::string &needle, const int &n) {
	auto count = 0;
    auto str = std::find_if(haystack.begin(), haystack.end(),
                            [&](const std::string &s) {
                                if (s == needle)
                                    count += 1;
                                return s == needle && count == n; });
    if(str != haystack.end()) {
        std::cout << "found " << *str << " at " << std::distance(haystack.begin(), str) << std::endl;
    }
}
```

In the two above examples, I also utilize `std::distance` to identify the found element’s index.

## `class` vs. `struct`

When moving from C to C++, I have asked myself (1) what the differences between `struct` and `class` are, and (2) which I should use when designing my code.

In term of language, the only difference is their default access of members and inheritance. If *access-specifier* (i.e., `public`, `private`, or `protected`) is omitted, members and inheritance of `struct` default to `public` whereas those of `class` default to `private`.  For example:

```C++
struct BaseStruct {
    int structMember;   // this is a public member and can be accessed directly via an instance of BaseStruct
};

struct DerivedStruct : BaseStruct { // Equivalent to: struct DerivedStruct : public BaseStruct
    ...
};

class BaseClass {
    int classMember;  // this is a private member and can NOT be accessed via an instance of BaseClass
};

struct DerivedClass : BaseClass { // Equivalent to: struct DerivedClass : private BaseClass
    ...
};
```

There is no concrete rule for making the choice (i.e., using `class` or `struct`) but only conventions. To me, here are the two significantly important ones:

1. `struct` is used to tie up some related data into a bundle to raise the level of abstraction (i.e., readability) of your code. Thus, it can have methods and base `struct` (i.e., inheritance) but typically don’t. For example, `struct point` is a coordinate consisting of `x` and `y` values, and calculating `distance` between two points should not be a method of the `struct`.

2. `class` is used if there is an invariant. An invariant is a relation between the data members of a `class`, and the relation must hold to avoid crashes. For example, an implement of `MySimpleString` has `buf` and `size` members, and its invariant is that the number of characters allocated for `buf` must match the value in `size`.

## Rule of five

[The rule of five](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_three_(C%2B%2B_programming)) is that if you define any of *destructor, copy constructor, copy assignment operator, move constructor,* or *move assignment operator*, then you should probably define all five. These methods are to handle resource such as deleting a pointer or closing a file. If you do not define these five methods, the compiler will generate default ones. And if one of the default methods is not sufficient for your needs, probably none of them are.
