In this blog post, I would like to share a compilation of insights and best practices that I have acquired through my experience with the C++ programming language.


## RAII technique

The concept of [RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)]( https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/raii) is a fundamental C++ programming technique. It entails binding the lifecycle of a resource to the lifetime of an object, ensuring that resources are acquired and released appropriately. To implement RAII:

1.	Encapsulate each resource within a `class` (or `struct`): the constructor acquires the resource, and the destructor releases it.
1.	Utilize the resource through a **local instance** of the class, avoiding the use of pointers or static variables.

Consider the following example illustrating the potential pitfalls of not employing RAII:

```C++
void allocateAndProcessMessage() {
    char* msg = new char[128];
    // Do something with 'msg' but not delete it.

    if (mystery_function() != 0) {
        // ERROR! 
        return; // Potential memory leak as 'msg' has not been deleted yet.
    }

    // No error and do something else ...

    delete []msg; // Another potential memory leak is that an exception occurs before this 'delete' statment is invoked.
}
```

Applying RAII by wrapping the resource using a `struct` (or `class`), we can eliminate the risk of memory leaks:

```C++
class RAIIManagedMessage {
public:
    RAIIManagedMessage() : msg(new char[128]) {}

    ~RAIIManagedMessage() {
        if (msg != nullptr)
            delete[] msg;
    }

    char *getMessage() const {
        return msg;
    }

private:
    char *msg = nullptr;
};

void raiiManagedMessageProcessing() {
    struct RAIIManagedMessage messageWrapper;

    // Do something with 'wrapper.getMessage()'.
    if (mystery_function() != 0) {
        // ERROR! 
        return;
    }

     // No potential memory leak as the destructor of 'wrapper' will be invoked when we leave this function for any reason.
}
```

While RAII is effective in preventing memory leaks, it introduces some overhead due to the need for creating new wrappers using `class` or `struct`. A workaround for this overhead is to use smart pointers with custom deleters. The following example demonstrates the same functionality using smart pointers:

```C++
void uniquePtrMessageProcessing() {
    std::unique_ptr<char, void (*)(char*)> uniquePtrMessage(
        new char[128],
        [](char* ptr) {
            if(ptr != nullptr)
                delete[] ptr;
        }
    );

    // Do something with 'uniquePtrMessage'.
    if (mystery_function() != 0) {
        // ERROR! 
        return;
    }

     // No potential memory leak as the deleter of 'uniquePtrMessage' will be invoked when we leave this function for any reason.
}

void sharedPtrMessageProcessing() {
    std::shared_ptr<char> sharedPtrMessage(
        new char[128],
        [](char* ptr) {
            if(ptr != nullptr)
                delete[] ptr;
        }
    );

    // Do something with 'uniquePtrMessage'.
    if (mystery_function() != 0) {
        // ERROR! 
        return;
    }

     // No potential memory leak as the deleter of 'uniquePtrMessage' will be invoked when we leave this function for any reason.
}
```

## Working with containers

### `auto` specifier in a range-based for loop

When employing a [range-based for loop](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/range-for), use the `auto` specifier for automatic type deduction in the `range_declaration`. Remember that `auto`` represents a *value type*, necessitating the use of `&`` to denote a *reference type* when modifications to the original elements are desired. See following example:

```C++
void useValueRangeBasedForLoop() {
    std::vector<std::string> strings { "first", "second", "third" };
    for(auto s : strings) {
        s.append(" new string");
    }

    // This will print: "frist", "second" and "third"
    for(auto s : strings) {
        std::cout << s << std::endl;
    }
}

void useReferenceRangeBasedForLoop() {
    std::vector<std::string> strings { "first", "second", "third" };
    for(auto &s : strings) {
        s.append(" new string");
    }

    // This will print: "frist new string", "second new string" and "third new string"
    for(auto s : strings) {
        std::cout << s << std::endl;
    }
}
```

In the first function (`useValueRangeBasedForLoop`), the `auto` specifier represents a value type, so modifications to `s` within the loop do not affect the original elements in the container. However, we use `auto &` in the second example (`useReferenceRangeBasedForLoop`). This denotes a reference type, and modifications made to `s` directly impact the original elements in the container.


### Finding an element with std::find_if

Utilize std::find_if to efficiently locate an element satisfying a specified criterion, avoiding the need for explicit loops. For example:

```C++
#include <algorithm>

// Finding the first occurrence of a string in a set of strings.
void findFirstOccurence(const std::vector<std::string> &haystack, const std::string &needle) {
    auto str = std::find_if(haystack.begin(), haystack.end(),
                            [&](const std::string &s) { return s == needle; });
    if(str != haystack.end()) {
        std::cout << "found " << *str << " at " << std::distance(haystack.begin(), str) << std::endl;
    }


// inding the nth occurrence of a string in a set of strings.
void findNthOccurence(const std::vector<std::string> &haystack, const std::string &needle, const int &n) {
	auto count = 0;
    auto str = std::find_if(haystack.begin(), haystack.end(),
                            [&](const std::string &s) {
                                if (s == needle)
                                    count += 1;
                                return s == needle && count == n; });
    if(str != haystack.end()) {
        std::cout << "found " << *str << " at " << std::distance(haystack.begin(), str) << std::endl;
    }
}}
```


## `class` vs. `struct`

The decision between using `class`` or `struct`` in C++ revolves around conventions rather than strict rules. The primary distinction lies in the default access of members and inheritance. If access-specifier is omitted, `struct` defaults to `public`, while `class` defaults to `private`.

```C++
struct BaseStruct {
    int structMember;   // this is a public member and can be accessed directly via an instance of BaseStruct
};

struct DerivedStruct : BaseStruct { // Equivalent to: struct DerivedStruct : public BaseStruct
    ...
};

class BaseClass {
    int classMember;  // this is a private member and can NOT be accessed via an instance of BaseClass
};

struct DerivedClass : BaseClass { // Equivalent to: struct DerivedClass : private BaseClass
    ...
};
```

There is no concrete rule for making the choice of using `class` or `struct`, but only conventions. To me, here are the two significantly important ones:

1. Use `struct` to bundle related data for improved code abstraction; it may have methods and base struct but typically doesn't.

2. Use `class` if there is an invariant, a relationship between the data members that must be upheld to avoid issues. For example, an implement of `MySimpleString` has `buf` and `size` members, and its invariant is that the number of characters allocated for `buf` must match the value in `size`.


## Rule of five

The [Rule of Five](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_three_(C%2B%2B_programming)) dictates that if you define any of *destructor, copy constructor, copy assignment operator, move constructor,* or *move assignment operator*, then you should probably define all five. These methods handle resource management, such as deleting a pointer or closing a file. Failing to define these methods prompts the compiler to generate default ones, potentially leading to insufficient behavior.
